<h2> Creational </h2>
- How objects are created.

  : Deal with different types of objects</br>
  Use case: Users - Admin, guest, special etc

- Builder</br>
  : Multiple parameters to deal with while creating objects </br>

<h2> Structural </h2>
- How objects relate to each other.

- Facade </br>
: Fancy encapsulation, all business logic can be hidden under facade. </br>
